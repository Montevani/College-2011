# College Stuff
A bunch of random stuff I did for a college class (ICC, Introduction to Computer Science) back in 2011 and maybe 2012.
Mostly C++ but there may be some C hidden somewhere!

Nothing particularly useful unless you're taking the same classes I took back then. Some of the final test answers are there somewhere!
